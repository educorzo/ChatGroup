### DP therapy chat-group.
Some research point out that positive communication between patients help them to recover faster.
Because of that, we want to create a chat therapy group where patients share their messages.

## MVP
- Create a system where patients send and receives messages from a chat group.
  We do not want private messages, so everybody will receive all messages.
  Patients must receive other patients messages but do not receive their own messages.
  For the sake of the exercise, the received message will be printed on the console.

## Following sprint
People start using our new chat, but they get confused because it is not possible to know when the message was sent.
- Add timestamp to each message. Remember to not break the Open Close Principle.

## Last sprint
We do not want anonymity anymore.
- Add sender into the message.
